==========================
1.16.1 - November 17, 2025
==========================

- Support newer versions of Mesa where format/modifier events have been
  deprecated by implementing the needed parts of the DMA-BUF feedback
  protocol in the nested compositor.

=======================
1.16.0 - March 13, 2025
=======================

- Fix the build with GCC 15.

============================
1.15.90 - September 13, 2024
============================

- Changed minimum Meson version to 0.52.1
- Fix build issues in some configurations that require an explicit cast
  to EGLNativeWindowType.
- Fix WebKit no longer repainting after provisional navigation with
  PSON enabled.
- Fix graphics buffer leaks by always freeing them in buffer destroy
  listener callbacks.
- Fix a crash caused by a wrong assertion, which was typically triggered
  in debug builds when using the NVidia drivers.
- Fix memory leak when the view backend wl_resource is destroyed.
- Fix wpe_dmabuf_pool object leak.

=======================
1.13.1 - August 9, 2022
=======================

- Fixed a crash caused by trying to deallocate already freed graphics
  buffers in certain situations.

========================
1.9.1 - February 3, 2021
========================

- Added API to query whether receiving rendered audio has been configured.
- The CMake build system has been removed in favor of Meson.
- Fixed memory leak on the second (and subsequent) use of
  wpe_fdo_initialize_shm().
- Fixed memory leak when releasing exportable view backends.

=====================
1.7.1 - July 29, 2020
=====================

- Added new API for the audio rendering protocol, which allows embedders to
  receive audio samples instead of letting WPE WebKit handle their playback.
- Added support to export frames using EGLStreams, which can be used e.g.
  with Nvidia GPUs.
- New build configuration system based on Meson. The existing CMake-based
  system is still maintained, and both produce the same outputs.
- Expose symbols for the version retrieval functions.
- Use libepoxy for EGL operations.

=====================
1.3.1 - June 13, 2019
=====================

- New macros in the API to check the version at compilation time.
- Added support for detaching and attaching new ones for a view backend.
- Improved handling of Wayland events.
- Improved how CMake searches for wayland-scanner, making it friendlier for
  cross-compilation.
- Fixed double-free of callback resources during destruction of view backends.

===================
1.3.0 - May 8, 2019
===================

- Do not include EGL headers in libwpe public headers.
- New API for exported images which allows querying their dimension their
  backing EGLImageKHR.
- Use the default priority for the GLib event sources.

=========================
1.1.0 - December 14, 2018
=========================

- Use the new libwpe API to notify when frames have been displayed.
- Allow calling wpe_fdo_initialize_for_egl_display() multiple times, with
  a warning printed to the standard error output when trying to switch
  displays (which is unsupported).
- Provide a dummy implementation of the EGL offscreen target interface, to
  let WebKit use Pbuffer-based offscreen contexts as fallback, instead of
  crashing.
- Minor cleanups in headers and function prototypes.

=======================
1.0.0 - August 21, 2018
=======================

- Updated to use libwpe 1.0.0.
- The libWPEBackend-fdo library now uses the libtool versioning convention.
- New API which supports exporting frames as EGL images. This provides
  applications with a ready to to render EGLImage, and has the advantage
  that the library hides the actual protocol used by the backend's nested
  compositor from the application.
- Improved dispatching of Wayland events.
- Support using DMA-BUF Wayland surfaces.
- Support using Wayland versions older than 1.10

====================
0.1 - April 26, 2018
====================

- Initial release
